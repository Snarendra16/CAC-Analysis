## Business Context
Minor formatting improvements.

The company is a financial services provider that relies heavily on digital marketing channels (paid search, social ads, display, affiliates) to acquire new customers.

In 2024, management noticed a worrying trend: **customer acquisition cost (CAC) is significantly higher than the industry benchmark** and appears to be creeping up through the year. This threatens profitability and constrains growth.

The **industry target CAC** is **150**, but the company’s **current average CAC is 230.42**, almost **53% higher** than the target.

This analysis uses quarterly CAC data from 2024 to:

- Understand the size and direction of the problem
- Compare against the benchmark
- Tell a clear data story for the executive team
- Recommend concrete actions to **optimize digital marketing channels**
